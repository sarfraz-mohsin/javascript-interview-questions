//let cannot be redeclared although it can be reassigned

// TEMPORAL DEAD ZONE - its a safety measure so that a let variable cannot be used before initialization

//const can never only be initialized we alwayas have to initalize it and we can never re initialize a const

// BLOCK ZONE {} inside the curly braces the let variable will have a different memory and different scope

// VARIABLE SHADOWING - when a variable have same name but they have different scope the variable inside the block will overshawod the global variable or outer variable
